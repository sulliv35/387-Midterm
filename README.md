# 387-Midterm, 3-axis Accelerometer 
ECE 387 Midterm 

I am going to use a Flora's Accelerometer + Compass to create a device that is able to sense it's position in all directions, oriented in any way. The device will use the flashing of LED's to state how close it is the default position; Upwards, Setting flat, and facing North. This will be done by checking the axis values of the accelerator to ensure both x and y axis are evened out at 0 (or at least close) and the z-axis is negative. Additionally the device will check direction it's facing by reading in the compass values.
